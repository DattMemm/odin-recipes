    <p>The Mojito is one of the most popular rum cocktails served today, 
        with a recipe known around the world. The origins of this classic drink 
        can be traced to Cuba and the 16th-century cocktail El Draque. 
        Named for Sir Francis Drake, the English sea captain and explorer 
        who visited Havana in 1586, El Draque was composed of aguardiente 
        (a cane-spirit precursor to rum), lime, mint and sugar. Eventually, rum replaced aguardiente and the name was 
        changed to the Mojito. It was supposedly consumed for medicinal purposes, 
        but itâ€™s easy to believe that drinkers enjoyed its flavor and effects.</p>
    <p>Appropriately, almost all of the ingredients in the Mojito are 
        indigenous to Cuba. Rum, lime, mint and sugar 
        (the island nation grows sugar cane) are joined together and then 
        lengthened with thirst-quenching club soda to create a delicious, 
        lighthearted cocktail. </p>
    <p>The Mojito is slightly more labor-intensive than other cocktails 
        because it involves muddling the mint, but the end result is worth the 
        effort. The mint combines with the other ingredients for an extra 
        dose of refreshment that, while often associated with summer, 
        can be enjoyed any time of the year</p>
