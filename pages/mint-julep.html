    <p>The Mint Julep is an iconic bourbon cocktail you definitely don't want to 
        miss. Drinks that are this popular can sometimes seem difficult to make, 
        but this recipe is actually incredibly easy and only requires a few 
        ingredients.</p>
    <p>Beyond the bourbon, sugar, and mint, the only other requirement for 
        this drink is crushed ice. Other forms of ice won't create the same 
        effect, so take the time to create a nice mound of crushed ice before 
        mixing this cocktail. Traditionally, Mint Juleps are served in silver or 
        pewter cups and held by the handle or rim so the cup maintains optimum 
        frost. They work just as well in any tall glass. </p>
    <p>The Mint Julep is the traditional drink of the Kentucky Derby, 
        which has helped propel the cocktail's popularity. Tens of thousands of 
        Mint Juleps are served at Churchill Downs in Louisville, and countless 
        more are enjoyed by fans watching the race throughout the country. 
        With a balance of sweet, smoky, and herbal flavors, the Mint Julep is 
        delicious all year long.</p>
