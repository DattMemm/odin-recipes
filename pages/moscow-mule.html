    <p>A Moscow mule is a classic cocktail born in the 1940’s, made with 
        vodka and ginger beer. It’s actually part of a family of cocktails 
        called a buck: a cocktail made with liquor, ginger ale or ginger beer, 
        and citrus juice. So, it can also be called a vodka buck! This 
        classic cocktail is on the list of International Bartender Association’s 
        IBA official cocktails.</p>
    <p>The Moscow Mule is a classic vodka-based cocktail that is 
        popular for good reason: It’s delicious, refreshing and a snap to make. 
        Just speaking the name of the drink conjures images of the ice-cold copper 
        mug that is the de rigueur vessel for the Moscow Mule. </p>
    <p>Any high-quality vodka will work nicely in the mule, but now is not the 
        time to experiment with subpar ginger beer. You want a top-notch option 
        that comes from a bottle, not a soda gun, and offers enough spicy bite 
        to complement the liquor and lime. Put the components together, and it’s 
        hard to think of a more restorative choice on a hot summer day.</p>
