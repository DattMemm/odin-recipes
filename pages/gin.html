    <p>The Gin Rickey is a highball cocktail made with gin, 
        soda water and lime juice. It was invented in the 1880’s with bourbon, 
        then became very popular with gin in the 1890’s. 
        The story goes that a Democratic politician named Colonel Joe Rickey 
        made up the drink in a Washington DC bar with the help of the bartender 
        there.</p>
    <p>The drink rose to worldwide popularity, and is even mentioned in books 
        like the 1920’s novel Great Gatsby. Though it’s a simple drink, 
        the rickey connects to a centuries long tradition of mixing booze 
        and carbonated water.</p>
